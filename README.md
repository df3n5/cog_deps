#Directory structure

src/
In here is contained the unmodified sources of each library.

include/
In here is the include directory of each project. 
This is so we can build against this instead of system versions, as these may conflict with the libs built.

lib/osx32
Libraries for OS X.

lib/win32
Libraries for win32.

lib/arch32
Libraries for arch32.

lib/ubuntu32
Libraries for ubuntu32.
